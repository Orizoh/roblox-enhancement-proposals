ROBLOX GUI Improvements
=======================

The GUI system on ROBLOX can be largely improved.  So far, GUI objects are only drawn as rectangles, there are limited 
fonts, the borders are restricted and there is efficent way to draw on these objects.

Below is a list of improvements that ROBLOX can implement which would increase the usefulness and flexibility of their GUI
objects:

* Rotatable GUI Objects
* Draggability locked on an axis
* HTML5 Canvas-like drawing methods
* Border width and border radius
* Non-discrete and non-limited layering system
* Create a default screen ratio
